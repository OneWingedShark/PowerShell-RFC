# PowerShell RFC Process and Guidelines

A PowerShell RFC (Request for Comments) is a publication to propose design changes and improvements to PowerShell.
This provides the community an opportunity to provide feedback before code is written where it becomes harder to change at the risk of 
compatibility.
The complete list of RFCs are available at https://github.com/powershell/powershell-rfc

This process was adapted from the Chef RFC process as well as from DMTF.org process.

## Roles

All members of the community are allowed to author new RFCs and can provide feedback to any RFC.

## RFC Naming Convention

RFC documents shall follow the naming convention of "RFC####-Title.md" where #### is the RFC number and Title is the title of the document.

## RFC Template

RFC documents shall follow the following template:

```markdown
---
RFC: <four digit unique incrementing number>
Author: <First Last>
Status: <Draft | Experimental | Accepted | Rejected | Final>
Version: <Major>.<Minor>
Area: <Area within the PowerShell language>

RFCs go through applicable stages:

* Draft

This is the initial draft of a RFC posted for comments and considered a work-in-progress.
Typically, two months is allowed for comments.

* Draft-Accepted

Comments have been reviewed and new comments are not being sought.
Code work has not started/planned or not needed.

* Experimental

Comments have been reviewed and code is being written to provide an working example of the proposed design change to get further feedback.

* Experimental-Accepted

Feedback from the experimental implementation and RFC have been reviewed.
Engineering team will work towards final implementation in code to match the RFC.

* Rejected

Based on community feedback, this RFC was decided to not proceed any further.

* Final

Design and implementation is considered complete.
Any proposed changes would be through a new RFC.
